 8. How do you explain technical concepts to non-technical customers?
 Explain technical concepts by: using simple, everyday language, avoiding jargon and acronyms, providing relatable analogies, breaking down complex processes into smaller steps, confirming understanding throughout, using visual descriptions when helpful, being patient with questions, and focusing on how the technology benefits them rather than technical details.
